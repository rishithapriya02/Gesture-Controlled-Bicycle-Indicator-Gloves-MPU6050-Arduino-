# Gesture-Controlled-Bicycle-Indicator-Gloves-MPU6050-Arduino-
Developed gesture-controlled bicycle indicator gloves using an MPU6050 IMU and Arduino. Hand tilt gestures are processed to detect left and right movements, triggering corresponding LED indicators. The system demonstrates real-time sensor interfacing, embedded control, and motion-based human–machine interaction.
